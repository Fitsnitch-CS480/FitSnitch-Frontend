Notes from Amplify:
Some next steps:
- "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
- "amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
- "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
- "amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
- "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
- Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify publish" to deploy everything
