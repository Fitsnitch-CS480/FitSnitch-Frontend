Status: App builds and loads login screen!

Packages not yet working:

- Anything firebase
  - packages have been removed and need to be added again
- react-native-config
  - Works fine for android still but iOS simply does not pick the vars up at all.
  - I've followed various tutorial but can't get it to work
  - Some sites say the project is deprecated, but I can't find anything else that would do the same thing

STILL does not support any sort of location tracking for iOS
